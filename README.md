this is simple cli tool to talk to nomiai api.

To run it, just install the go programing language, and git then:

````
git clone https://github.com/AQMpolyface/nomiai-cli.git
cd nomiai-cli
go run nomi.go
````

the script will create a config.json in your current directory.
You will get prompted for your api key.

The nomi go sdk (https://github.com/vhalmd/nomi-go-sdk) helped me a lot to create some part of my code.

I would appreciate if you found a bug, or had an idea to make the tool better, please let me know via github. thanks!
